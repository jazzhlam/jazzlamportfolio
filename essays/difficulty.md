	The artist I have chosen to write about is Jan Švankmajer, known for his film making and his skill at making compelling narratives and social commentary through stop motion, claymation and live action work. I was drawn especially to the absurdist nature in making these films. As an artist I feel like we are meant to create, to either bring forward qualities of something into the light or to make something people have never seen before. Especially with experimental art I believe that in some way the art has to be something to the artist. The works that Jan has made push boundaries in many ways, being social and political message, as well as being very intricately designed films that to my knowledge there isn't really anything else like it. His use of pixelation, claymation, and stop motion really interests me as a creator since I do a lot of work with clay anyway, makes me really want to create something uncanny and dynamic using clay.
	Jan is a retired Czech film director, animator, writer, playwright and artist. In his childhood he was influenced by his home puppet theater that starting at the age of 8 has kept his mind on puppets for the rest of his life. “His own inspiration comes from his training in puppeteering; his literary influences, especially Lewis Carroll and Edgar Allan Poe; Freudian psychoanalysis; and a strong belief in subverting humanity’s anthropocentrism.” (Babou691). Throughout the years he has made over 30 films and has been awarded and nominated for countless awards, however turning down all the ones granted by the government. Throughout his history, he has done many works using puppets, claymation, stop motion, and live action to make the films have the effect that he wanted. These were commentaries on society as a whole and was able to speak about politics in his own absurd way.
Some of the sentiments and mentalities that Svankmajer shares were very unique and interesting. There are many instances where he chooses to have humility and do things for the masses in his creations. In an interview with him "I never call myself an animated filmmaker because I am interested not in animation techniques or creating a complete illusion, but in bringing life to everyday objects." (Wendy Jackson). Over the span of his career was awarded many awards and despite being offered them declined any from governments. This did however cause problems for him eventually leading to him being banned from filmmaking in the 1970s for his political films. In an interview he also mentions that there is no such thing as talent and that an artist is able to reach their resources and overcome their block and that a person who is stuck in their professionalism will not be able to. They need to express themselves and will be able to if they want it enough. As someone who has tried hard to pick up many different skills especially in the arts over the years I cannot advocate for this enough. That effort and vision are the things that people need to be able to create good art. That only time and effort are the things that can hold a person back.
Jan Svankmajer’s style of making absurd and uncanny art is what attracted me to his films. A normal film or a matter of fact reading is boring in comparison. His films bring out emotions from the audience very efficiently with overloading with information and unpredictable narratives. If the film is overly predictable watching it all the way through becomes more of a chore, it makes in general horror or mystery much more immersive than superhero or action movies especially American made. There have been studies done on comedy in the past that also contribute to why it works and the three things that impact it the most are incongruity, superiority, and relief. These three things are very important to keep for comedy to work. These are not used only for comedy however. I found them quite important to use in any type of media to keep people entertained and interested. His use of relatable media while also putting many twists on our expectations keep the audience captivated on his political and social messages.
I enjoyed watching Jan Svankmajer’s films and found him as a person even more interesting because I was able to see the mindset he has with his film making. Seeing someone with so much skill and creative power to have the humility to be able to speak for the people was very inspiring.
