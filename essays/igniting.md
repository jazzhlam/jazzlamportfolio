As someone who has now been at UH for 4 years in total I have finally lit a fire underneath my behind if you will. Not to get out of college but to learn and make it into the real world I've been somewhat avoiding overall. I've been coasting all this time through it and need to finally get it together in this last spurt through. I will use this Software Engineering class as a springboard to be properly thinking in comparison to all the previous classes.

Most CS classes at UH are focused towards memorization and optimization, however after hearing all the things about this class during the first week, applying myself to this will have more of an impact than calculating 0(N) optimizations. Generating code that works should be the highlight personally.

I look forward to learning more of a real world application.
