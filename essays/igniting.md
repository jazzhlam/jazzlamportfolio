## Making the Shift

After four years navigating computer science coursework, I've come to realize there's a fundamental difference between understanding algorithms and building software that people actually use. Most of my academic journey focused on theoretical concepts—analyzing time complexity, optimizing algorithms, and solving abstract problems. These skills matter, but I found myself questioning whether I could translate this knowledge into creating functional applications.

That realization sparked a shift in my approach. Rather than simply coasting through remaining requirements, I decided to actively pursue courses and projects that would bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world software development.

## Beyond Big O Notation

While calculating Big O complexity has its place, I've learned that professional software engineering involves so much more. Building maintainable code, collaborating with teams, managing project timelines, and creating intuitive user interfaces—these practical skills don't always appear in traditional algorithms courses but are essential for a successful career in technology.

The most valuable lesson I've learned is that code needs to be more than just correct—it needs to be readable, maintainable, and solve real problems for real users. This perspective has fundamentally changed how I approach programming.

## Looking Forward

I'm now focused on developing well-rounded software engineering skills. This means gaining experience with version control systems, learning modern development frameworks, understanding project management methodologies, and building portfolio projects that demonstrate practical problem-solving abilities.

The transition from student to professional developer requires more than technical knowledge—it demands the ability to work on teams, communicate effectively about technical decisions, and continuously learn new technologies. These are the skills that will actually matter in my career, and I'm committed to developing them through hands-on experience and real-world projects.
