# Design Patterns


## What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to a common problem in software design. They’re used in both the development of the look of the program and in the backend to keep things working together and cleanly. This allows developers to solve common problems efficiently and maintain a high level of code quality.

Think of it like building a skyscraper: multiple walls are segmented and put together, then pulled together to form the whole building. Each wall is built with the same pattern and modified to fit its purpose. Coding design patterns work similarly—certain modules and segments of code are reusable and can be combined to create a complete software system. It’s like having a toolbox of reliable techniques, so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time you face a new challenge.

Design patterns also help teams communicate and collaborate. When everyone is using the same patterns, it’s easier to understand each other’s code and avoid confusion. They help prevent common pitfalls and make code easier to read, maintain, and extend. In a way, design patterns are the glue that holds a project together, making sure everything fits and works as intended.


## Design Patterns in My Final Project
In the creation of Study Buddy, our final project, design patterns played a huge role in making sure our code was consistent, maintainable, and easy to work with. For example, during our signup process, we used a dropdown for users to select their courses. Later, when users created events, we reused the exact same dropdown design pattern—saving time and ensuring a familiar experience for users.

Throughout our web design, we focused on keeping a consistent look and feel by sticking to established design patterns. This made the site easier to navigate and more visually appealing. Behind the scenes, we used patterns to organize our code, making it easier to update and debug. By relying on these tried-and-true solutions, we were able to build a project that was both functional and polished—just like a well-built house or a perfectly plated meal.
