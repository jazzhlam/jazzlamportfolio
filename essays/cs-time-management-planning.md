# CS Time Management Planning

![Time management road](../img/time-management-road.jpg)

## What Is Effort Estimation

Effort estimation is the process of predicting how much time, resources, and work a task or project will require to complete. In software development, it involves breaking down complex work into manageable pieces and estimating the duration of each piece based on past experience, complexity, and potential risks. This can be done through guesswork or estimation based off how long other simlar branches take. Accurate estimation helps teams plan realistic timelines, allocate resources efficiently, and deliver quality results without overcommitting.

## Why You Should Estimate Effort

Estimating effort is crucial for staying on track and avoiding burnout. Without estimation, projects can spiral into scope creep and missed deadlines, creating stress and poor-quality work. By estimating upfront, you gain visibility into what's realistically achievable, can prioritize effectively, and build in buffer time for unexpected challenges. Good estimation also fosters better communication with stakeholders and helps you maintain a sustainable work-life balance by setting boundaries and saying "no" to commitments you can't reasonably handle.

## Time Management in My Experience

Balancing work life, school, and side projects in CS has been a constant exercise in experience and effort estimation. I’ve learned to designate time through this project by being able to estimate and set specific pockets of time dedicated to what needs to be done. Through this planning ample time has been able to be allocated properly to ensure that even when problems arise the solution can be reached without too many things happening. Every task of this project was able to be set and worked on in a timely manner without the need of excessive scope creep through what if questions as well as proper school, work, sleep, assignment time management. The added bonus being harder focus being able to be acchieved due to everything laid out ahead of time.
