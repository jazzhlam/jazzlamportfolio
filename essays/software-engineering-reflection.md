# Beyond Web Development: Lessons in Software Engineering

![Software Engineering](../img/software-engineering.jpg)

## I. Introduction

When I first enrolled in ICS 314, I came with few expectations. I was looking forward to learning more diverse and useful things in this class and less of a focus away from fundamentals, algorithms and optimization. I was both glad to see the diversification and the wide teachings of JS, HTML, Typescript, etc. as well as Coding standards and a lot of univeral tools, however was extremely concerned about the workload that I learned of in the first few days.

## II. Agile Project Management: Flexibility Beyond the Browser

### What is Agile Project Management?

Agile Project Management emphasizes iterative progress, team collaboration, and adaptability to changing requirements. Rather than planning everything upfront, Agile breaks work into small chunks called sprints, with each producing working software that can be reviewed and adjusted. It prioritizes working software over documentation, responding to change over following fixed plans, and continuous collaboration and reflection.

### Issue Driven Project Management

In this course, we used Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM), where all work is organized around specific tasks called "issues." Each issue has clear acceptance criteria, an assigned team member, and progresses through stages tracked on a project board. IDPM's power comes from its transparency—anyone can see what's being worked on, who's responsible, and what's completed.

### Applications Beyond Web Development

IDPM isn't just for web apps. Whether developing machine learning systems, robotics projects, or data analysis tools, IDPM provides a framework for managing complexity and collaboration. For example, a machine learning project could use issues to track data cleaning, model training, and evaluations, while a robotics project could organize sensor integration and testing protocols the same way. The approach is technology-agnostic and works for any complex software project.

## III. Design Patterns: Universal Solutions to Common Problems

### What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common software design problems. They're templates that describe how to solve problems in tested ways. Common patterns include Singleton (one class instance), Observer (objects notified of state changes), Factory (object creation without specifying classes), and MVC (separates data, presentation, and control logic).

### Design Patterns in Web Development

During this course, we encountered design patterns frequently. Our Meteor applications naturally followed the MVC pattern, separating database models (MongoDB collections), views (React components), and controllers (method calls and publications). We used the Observer pattern through Meteor's reactive data system, where UI components automatically updated when underlying data changed.

### Beyond Web Applications

Design patterns apply to all object-oriented programming. In game development, Observer patterns handle event systems when players collect items. In embedded systems, Singleton manages hardware connections. I've used Strategy patterns in data analysis projects to switch between statistical methods cleanly. These patterns provide a shared vocabulary that works across all software domains, giving me tools I'll use regardless of what I'm building.

## IV. Coding Standards: The Foundation of Professional Software

### What are Coding Standards?

Coding Standards are guidelines for writing consistent, readable, and maintainable code. They cover formatting, naming conventions, and commenting practices. Standards improve readability, make code easier to modify and debug, enable better collaboration, and help prevent common bugs. In this course, we used ESLint to automatically check our code, which taught me to write clean code from the start.

### The Bigger Picture

Coding standards instill discipline and professionalism. Initially, ESLint's complaints about spacing and formatting seemed annoying, but I realized these details matter in professional development. Standards reflect respect for teammates and your future self, making debugging and understanding old code much easier.

### Universal Application

Every programming language has coding standards—Python has PEP 8, Java has its own conventions, and so on. These community agreements make collaboration possible and encompass principles like writing clear code, keeping functions focused, avoiding duplication, and handling errors well. The discipline I learned from ESLint transfers to any language. Standards aren't restrictions—they're tools that enable professional engineering.

## V. Synthesis: Engineering Mindset Over Specific Technologies

### Connecting the Concepts

Agile Project Management, Design Patterns, and Coding Standards represent an engineering mindset—a systematic approach to building maintainable software. This course taught me that software engineering isn't about specific technologies, which will change. What endures are fundamental practices: breaking problems into manageable pieces, applying proven solutions, and writing clean code others can understand.

### Transferable Skills

These concepts address universal challenges: complexity, collaboration, change, and maintenance. Whether working on web apps, mobile apps, embedded systems, or anything else, these principles apply across all software development.

## VI. Conclusion

ICS 314 taught me React, MongoDB, and Meteor, but the deeper value came from software engineering fundamentals that transcend technology. Agile Project Management taught me to work iteratively and collaborate effectively. Design Patterns gave me proven solutions and shared vocabulary. Coding Standards instilled discipline and professionalism. These practices apply to any software context, not just web development. The real lesson wasn't how to build a web app—it was learning to think like a software engineer, a skill that will remain valuable throughout my career.

## Reflection Attribution

This essay reflects my personal understanding and experiences from ICS 314. The structure and grammar were refined with assistance from AI tools, but all insights, examples, and reflections are based on my genuine learning throughout the course.
