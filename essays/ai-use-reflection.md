# Reflecting on AI Use in ICS 314

![AI and Education](../img/ai-education.jpg)

## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has become an increasingly popular tool for many espeically in fields such as education and programming. It has been a good tool to many to efficiently speed up production time and a crutch to others allowing for fast unmonitored generated answers to be used in place of human made. I've had the opportunity to explore how AI technologies can assist in learning, problem-solving, and code development. Throughout this course, I primarily used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to help both understanding and to efficiently code.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

### Experience WODs (e.g., E18)

For Experience WODs, I used ChatGPT sparingly and primarily for help setting up the structure to coding and with problem solving. In many different situations it was very helpful to make the tedious work of creating a baseline faster and helped fix issues.

### In-class Practice WODs

For practice WODs, I used GitHub Copilot occasionally for learning the things I did not know. It helped speed things up, but sometimes it suggested weird code that didn't match what we were learning. I had to double-check everything it gave me.

### In-class WODs

I used AI for the graded WODs with the idea of finishing things on time and in many different cases it would half help and require the same if not more time to check and parse through. It helped somewhat when stuck.

### Essays

For essays, I used ChatGPT for structure and grammar help. I'd ask for a skeleton but all the actual content and experiences are mine. It just helped make sure my writing was clear and organized.

### Final Project

I used AI a lot for the final project. There was a lot of things to implement and do and not enough time in the day to balance it. All code was throughly checked through both test cases, compatability tests on many different branches before merging to main. The base ideas and snippets of code was used to help.

### Learning a Concept/Tutorial

AI was super helpful for learning new stuff. It allowed for the steps to be explained and when I had specific questions that google would not answer easily, AI tools would help out.

### Answering a Question in Class or Discord

I barely used AI for answering questions because I wanted to make sure I actually knew what I was talking about. 

### Asking or Answering a Smart-Question

Sometimes I used ChatGPT to help phrase technical questions better. Like asking "How do I phrase a question about React component rendering issues in a clear way?" helped me write questions that actually got useful answers.

### Coding Example

AI was great for quick examples. I'd ask some very specific prompts in this last project and would use it to help structure and make sure that the program could run better than what I wrote..

### Explaining Code

When code confused me, I'd paste it into ChatGPT and ask "Explain what this JavaScript function does line by line." Really helpful for callbacks and promises. Sometimes the explanations were too wordy, but mostly it cleared things up.

### Writing Code

I used AI a lot for boilerplate and standard patterns. Asking for something like "Write a React component that displays a list of items with edit and delete buttons" gave me a good starting point. Made things way faster, though sometimes the code was overly complicated or didn't match our project style.

### Documenting Code

Copilot was perfect for documentation. I'd give it code and ask "Write comments for this function" and get good documentation that I could tweak as needed. Saved tons of time.

### Quality Assurance

AI was a lifesaver for ESLint errors. I'd paste the code with "Fix the ESLint errors in this code" and problems got solved fast. Same with debugging—asking "What's wrong with this code" caught issues I missed. Though I know I should probably learn to spot these myself.

### Other Uses in ICS 314

I also used AI for generating test cases, understanding error messages, and learning best practices. Basically whenever I got stuck or needed to speed something up.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI has been both helpful and kind of problematic for my learning. On the good side, it's made understanding complex stuff way faster—instant explanations instead of waiting for office hours. I could keep momentum on tough assignments instead of getting stuck.

But there's a downside. When I rely on AI too much, I sometimes skip the struggle that actually makes you learn. I might understand an AI solution enough to use it but can't recreate it from scratch later. That's concerning.

Overall, AI has shown me good coding practices and helped with documentation, but I need to be careful not to use it as a crutch that prevents real understanding.

## IV. Practical Applications

During this class, I've used AI for these projects that helped making web design a lot faster and to make more sense.

For team projects, AI was great for keeping our code consistent and documenting everything so we could all understand each other's work.

That said, AI has limits. It's great for common problems but struggles with specific business logic or unique requirements. For those, you still need actual human thinking.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

The biggest challenge is figuring out when to use AI versus doing it yourself. Too much AI and you don't learn. Too little and you're wasting time. Finding that balance is tough.

Another issue is that AI code sometimes has bugs or uses old approaches. You need to already know enough to spot these problems, which is hard for beginners.

Also, not everyone has access to the same AI tools, which could create unfair advantages.

For the future, it would be cool to have:
- AI tools that give hints instead of full solutions
- AI that can check your code and give feedback like a TA
- Personalized practice problems based on what you're struggling with

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Traditional learning versus AI-enhanced learning both have their place.

AI gives you instant feedback and help, which keeps you engaged. But traditional methods with classmates and group work create a different kind of engagement that AI can't match.

When it comes to actually remembering stuff, struggling through problems yourself seems to stick better than having AI explain everything. But AI is great for showing you multiple examples quickly.

For skills, traditional methods build problem-solving and persistence. AI shows you professional code and best practices. Honestly, you need both—AI for efficiency and exposure to good code, traditional methods for building real understanding.

AI is definitely faster for routine stuff, but sometimes that slower traditional approach builds better fundamentals.

## VII. Future Considerations

AI in software engineering education is only going to get bigger. Future AI tools will probably offer personalized tutoring that adapts to how each student learns. That could be really powerful.

But there's a challenge—how do you make sure students still learn fundamentals when AI can do so much? Schools will need to rethink how they teach and test.

I think future courses should teach us how to use AI effectively instead of banning it. That means:
- Learning how to write good prompts
- Being tested on using AI well, not just using it
- Focusing on skills AI can't do, like system design and creative problem-solving

We also need to talk about ethics. When is using AI cheating versus just being smart about tools?

The goal should be preparing us to work with AI in the real world while still understanding the fundamentals.

## VIII. Conclusion

Looking back at my AI use in ICS 314, I see both big benefits and real limitations. AI made me faster and showed me professional-quality code. But it also made me realize I need to be careful about when AI helps versus when it prevents the struggle that actually teaches you stuff.

For future courses, I'd suggest:

1. Clear rules about when AI is okay to use
2. Teaching us how to use AI well and evaluate its output
3. Tests that check both AI skills and fundamental knowledge
4. Making us document when we use AI so we think about it
5. Discussing the ethics of AI use

AI isn't good or bad—it's a tool. Used right, it can help us learn while still building real skills. The goal should be preparing us for a career where AI is everywhere but we still have strong fundamentals to fall back on.

## AI Attribution

This essay's structure and initial organization were aided by Copilot. All personal experiences, examples, and reflections are my own. AI assisted with grammar checking and ensuring clear articulation of ideas, but the substance and authenticity of the reflection remain entirely from my personal experience in ICS 314.
