<h1>Design Patterns:</h1>

<h2>What Are Design Patterns?</h2>
<p>Design patterns are reusable solutions to a common problem in software 
    design. Either used in the development of the look of the program 
    but also in the backend to keep things working together and cleanly.
    This allows developers to solve common problems efficiently and 
    maintain a high level of code quality. For example when building 
    a skyscraper, multiple walls are segmented and put together and then 
    pulled together to form the whole building where each wall is built with
    the same pattern and modified to fit its purpose. Coding design patterns
    work similarly where certain modules and segments of code are reusable and 
    can be combined to create a complete software system.</p>

<h2>Design Patterns in My Final Project</h2>
<p>We used many different design patterns in the creation of Study Buddy, our
    final project, to make sure that continuity and code quality were able to be
    fulfilled. For example during our signup process, we have a dropdown for the 
    user to select courses that they are enrolled in and later in our process we
    used the exact same dropdown design pattern to allow users to select their 
    course when they are creating an event. Throughout our web design we did our
    best to keep a consistent design pattern to make sure that the format and layout
    looked similar.
