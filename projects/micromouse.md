## Overview

Throughout my computer science coursework at the University of Hawaii, I've worked on various academic projects that helped me develop a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. These projects ranged from implementing classic algorithms to optimizing code for performance.

## Key Learning Areas

**Algorithms and Optimization:** I gained experience analyzing time complexity using Big O notation and implementing efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal. Understanding these fundamental concepts has been crucial for writing better code in all my projects.

**Data Structures:** I worked with various data structures including linked lists, trees, hash tables, and graphs. Learning when and why to use each structure helped me make better design decisions in larger projects.

**C++ Programming:** Many of these projects were implemented in C++, teaching me about memory management, pointers, and object-oriented programming principles that form the foundation of modern software development.

## Skills Developed

These academic exercises taught me to think systematically about problems, break them down into manageable pieces, and implement solutions that are both correct and efficient. While these may have been classroom assignments, the problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking I developed have proven invaluable in all my subsequent software development work.

The experience of debugging complex recursive algorithms and optimizing code performance gave me confidence to tackle more ambitious projects like web applications and game development, where these fundamental concepts continue to apply.
